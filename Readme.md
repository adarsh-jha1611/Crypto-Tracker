Crypto-Tracker is a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and managed with Yarn package manager. It leverages the Coingecko API to provide real-time cryptocurrency data and tracking capabilities.

The application allows users to view the latest prices, historical data, and market trends of various cryptocurrencies. Users can search for specific cryptocurrencies, view detailed information about each coin, and add them to their watchlist for easy monitoring.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts - Frontend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will  reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are 
ready for it.


## Available Scripts - Backend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`
or
### `nodemon server.js`
with the latest version of Nodemon

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser.
